# KiCAD Hardware AI for Quantum Computing - User Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the AI-enhanced version of KiCAD for designing quantum computing hardware. The AI integration includes features such as AI-assisted schematic generation, PCB layout optimization, and simulation and analysis tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- KiCAD
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Qiskit
- Cirq

### Installation
Run the `deployment_script.sh` as root to install all the necessary dependencies and set up the environment.

```bash
sudo ./deployment_script.sh
```

## Features

### AI-Based Schematic Generation
The AI model can automatically generate schematics for quantum computing circuits. To use this feature, you need to provide input data for the quantum circuit design. The input data should be a list of floating-point numbers.

```cpp
std::vector<double> input_data = GetUserInput();
std::string circuit_design = GenerateQuantumCircuit(input_data);
```

### AI-Optimized PCB Layouts
The AI model can also optimize the layout of printed circuit boards (PCBs) for quantum computing. The optimized layout is generated based on the schematic generated by the AI model.

```cpp
std::string pcb_layout = OptimizePCBLayout(circuit_design);
```

### Simulation and Analysis Tools
The simulation and analysis tools allow you to simulate the quantum circuit and analyze the simulation results. The simulation results are returned as a histogram.

```python
simulation_tools = SimulationTools()
result = simulation_tools.simulate_circuit(circuit)
histogram = simulation_tools.analyze_results(result)
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the AI-enhanced KiCAD, please refer to the error messages in the console. The error messages will provide information about the issue and potential solutions.

## Feedback
We welcome feedback from the KiCAD and quantum computing communities. If you have any suggestions for improvements or new features, please let us know.
